This is the primary project to drive sub-projects prefixing with toolchain-

This project parses the build request from command line and
* Route the build commands into corresponding sub-projects
* Checkout the sub-projects with appropriate revisions
* Invoke the build commands of the sub-projects

Currently supported sub-projects:
* toolchain-gnu-bare-metal (Build GNU AArch32 bare-metal targets)

Please read README in the corresponding sub-projects for system requirement
before actually building.

Examples of build request.
1. Build Arm 32-bit bare-metal gcc hosted on linux and Windows (default behavior)
./main-build.sh --target=arm-none-eabi --compiler=gcc --host=linux,mingw # or
./main-build.sh

2. Build Arm 32-bit bare-metal gcc hosted on linux only
./main-build.sh --target=arm-none-eabi --compiler=gcc --host=linux

3. Build Arm 32-bit bare-metal gcc hosted on Mac OS
./main-build.sh --target=arm-none-eabi --compiler=gcc --host=darwin # run this on a Mac OS machine

Run ./main-build.sh -h for a complete list of options allowed
