This is the primary project to drive sub-projects prefixing with toolchain-.

What this project does is to parse the build request from command line and
* Route the build commands into corresponding sub-projects
* Checkout sub-projects with appropriate revisions
* Invoke the build commands in sup-projects

Currently supported sub-projects:
* toolchain-gnu-bare-metal (Build GNU AArch32 bare-metal targets)
